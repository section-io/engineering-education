##### Introduction
[Search Engine Optimization(SEO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) is a kind of Internet advertising method in which the websites are optimized to enhance the quality and quantity of their search engine traffic. It is beneficial due to the fact that a website will get hold of extra traffic from a search engine by getting ranked better at the Search Engine Result Page(SERP). It means it&#39;ll ensure that search engines such as Google, Firefox optimize search results and provide the best and helpful results to users which will be relevant to their search query. This article will explain what SEO is, why it is useful, and discuss two types of SEO techniques, namely: White-Hat and Black-Hat.

##### What is SEO?

SEO is a type of Internet marketing technique that involves learning how search engines operate. It is powered by computer-programmed algorithms that comprehend search engine behavior, such as what users look for, what they like, and what they want to see. These are computed, and they ensure that these results reach their intended audience.

When a user searches a query in the search engine, it presents two types of search results in the SERP

- Organic results
- Inorganic results

SEO has an impact on organic search results. The search engine puts up those results which are truly ranked higher on the SERP. These results are not intervened by any 3rd party applications. While inorganic results are nothing more than sponsored advertisements or bought results. Some websites and businesses utilize advertising to modify their site ranking in order to get visitors to visit their website. These are the results that frequently appear because they are paid to be at the top of the SERP.

##### How does it help?
Having websites listed on top of the SERP is useful because it will attract more visitors since they tend to click on the first two three links displayed on the results page. These visitors can be potentially converted from temporary visitors to permanent visitors. It indicates that if a visitor is impressed by a website or its content, regardless of where the website is listed in the SERP, the visitor will want to visit that specific website exclusively. Take, for example, Wikipedia. We search Wikipedia articles willingly for any person&#39;s information. So, when it comes to SEO rankings, having high-quality content on your site is a must.

Many features and aspects must be addressed in order to achieve a high SEO ranking. They are mainly classified into two factors, namely

- On-Page
- Off-Page

On-page factors are those that occur within the website, and off-page factors are those that occur outside of the webpage. On-page factors include using keywords that match the search query, relevant title tags, a suitable body structure, utilizing internal links, and so on. Similarly, Off-page factors include using social media, marketing, branding, local SEO, backlinking, and so on. These factors may help the website to maximize its engagement rate with the targeted audience. If used properly this will help the website to achieve a higher position on the SERP, thus more likely to be clicked.

##### White-Hat and Black-Hat
The white hat SEO is essentially a way of implementing optimization techniques that follow the laws and restrictions imposed by search engines. Using these techniques to enhance our website may not yield immediate benefits, but they may surface gradually. The white-hat SEO techniques may essentially include creating unique and diverse content, using high-quality keywords, including good metadata, an easily navigable website structure with superior UI/UX design, and many more. Implementing them in our website may be considered a good practice which helps boost the SEO ranking progressively and preserve the credibility of the website. Implementing them on our website may be regarded as a beneficial practice, as it aids in the gradual increase in the SEO ranking and preserving the website&#39;s credibility.

In the same way, black hat SEO is a way of implementing optimization techniques that do not follow the laws and restrictions imposed by search engines. Using these techniques may sometimes yield immediate benefits such as a sudden increase in SEO ranking or displaying the website on top of the SERP in the first query itself. Inserting auto-generated pages in the website, irrelevant keywords, hidden texts, content cloaking, spamdexing, and many more are considered black-hat SEO techniques. Although using them may provide immediate better results in connecting with the audience, they are not recommended since if any user is not satisfied with a website appearing at the top of the SERP that is unrelated to their query, they have the option to report it. The search engine may also detect any unusual behavior, and with the added danger of several reports from various users, there might be a possibility of the website getting banned.

##### SEO Marketing Tools
There are numerous aspects to consider while optimizing your website. Some of these have already been discussed. However, managing and maintaining them at the same time appears to be a difficult task. It is also not only about using them and integrating them on the website; it is also about monitoring them and how they influence the audience&#39;s engagement rate. With that performance, the website should be able to improve and develop in areas where it now falls short. This is when SEO tools come in handy. They are essentially third-party applications that provide reliable resources and services to manage the SEO of your website. Some of them are discussed below.

One of the best Google Analytics features is that it can identify badly performing sites based on information such as where visitors came from, how long they remained on the website, and their geographical location. This helps the user to improve the website qualitatively based on the reports. More details about Google Analytics can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics).

- [Yoast](https://yoast.com/)
It is a WordPress SEO plug-in that was previously known as WordPress SEO. This, like the other SEO tools, is focused on keyword research. It is the most well-known SEO plugin, having been downloaded millions of times and running on millions of websites. Yoast SEO helps in optimizing your site&#39;s pages and articles for the specific keywords you want to rank for by defining a focus keyword. It ranks posts and articles based on the number of times the keywords were used, the number of paragraphs, the length of sentences, the use of internal links, and so on. Using this information, the plug-in analyzes the posts, indicating whether additional optimization is necessary or not. As a result, the readability of the posts improves, hence contributing to a large collection of unique content. [Here&#39;s](https://yoast.com/what-does-yoast-seo-do/) a detailed explanation of what Yoast SEO does.

##### Conclusion
The key thing to remember about SEO is that it must be integrated into the site design process and not added in later. It is recommended to design and create a website with SEO techniques included from the beginning. SEO is something that may help a website to develop in terms of community and content. As a result, it should be done in a proper manner and on proper terms. Hence, white hat techniques should be utilized instead of black hat techniques since they comply with search engines&#39; rules and regulations. Although black hat SEO is not illegal and may even yield faster and better results, it does violate search engines&#39; policies. Using them, therefore, implies expecting the website to be banned or penalized.
