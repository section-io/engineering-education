For most developers, there is a need to run multiple GitHub accounts on one computer. For instance, You can have an organization's GitHub account and another for your projects at home.
  
In this article, you will learn how to [use multiple SSH keys for different GitHub accounts](https://gist.github.com/jexchan/2351996). While working with two different GitHub accounts, you must set them up using an SSH key. Then you need to set up SSH config to manage multiple GitHub accounts on one computer.

### Prerequisites
To grasp what this article entails. It is crucial to have a good understanding of how GitHub works.

### What are SSH Keys
[SSH refers to Secure Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell_Protocol). A cryptographic network protocol that allows a single computer to connect to a server over the internet securely. SSH is best used for accessing remote servers.

SSH is designed to offer secure encryption, verification, and communication between computers. It provides a safe way of executing commands and configuring services remotely. The SSH technology is often performed using the client-server model. So you can securely log in remotely from one system to another and transmit files.

Setting up SSH, you use a pair of keys, a public key and a private key. A public key is stored on the SSH server, and a private key is stored on your SSH client. So basically, SSH uses [asymmetric encryption](https://sectigostore.com/blog/what-is-asymmetric-encryption-how-does-it-work/#:~:text=Asymmetric%20encryption%20is%20a%20type,corresponding%20private%20key%20decrypts%20it.&text=The%20public%20key%20is%20open,and%20encrypt%20data%20with%20it.). 

To establish a connection between your computer(SSH client ) and the webserver (SSH server). The SSH server encrypts a message using the public key and sends it to the client. The client decrypts the message with a private key and sends it back to the SSH server. A connection is then established once the verification is complete.

### How to manage SSH keys on GitHub Accounts

#### Generating the SSH keys
Before generating SSH keys, make sure you have two different GitHub accounts. Your account and your company's GitHub account.

You can use your CMD or Git bash to run the commands. Navigate to the directory and run the below command for each GitHub account.

```ssh
# navigating to the ssh directory, run the following command.
cd .ssh/

# Generate SSH key for each GitHub account
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_name@email.com"
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_name@organization_email.com"
```

The key generator will prompt you for a file name. Enter a unique name like:

```ssh
id_rsa_personal
id_rsa_work
```

![Generating SSH key for my company's account](/engineering-education/using-multiple-ssh-keys-for-multiple-github-accounts/work.jpg)

Now that you have created two distinct keys that are listed below.

```ssh
id_rsa_personal
id_rsa_work
```

After generating the keys, use the following command to check if all keys were created.

`ls ~/.ssh`

The following files list is presented.

#### Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account
Now that we have the SSH keys, let us link them with the Github account.
To obtain the SSH key execute this command:

`cat id_rsa_personal.pub`

Copy the SSH key and then sign in to your GitHub account. Follow the steps below to add an SSH key to your GitHub account.
1. On your GitHub, navigate to Settings
2. Choose SSH and GPG keys
3. Hit on button New SSH Key, give a significant title, and paste the key
4. Finally, click the Add Key button

### Creating and updating the SSH config file
Finally, let us bring it all together in a config file. There are two GitHub accounts, the personal and work accounts. The personal account is the local account, and work is the global account.

The SSH config file is accessed by running this command:

`~/.ssh/config`

If it exists, you can edit it, or else it can be created using this command:

```ssh
touch config
nano config
```

Update the config file by adding the following rules:

```ssh
# Personal account, - the default config
Host github.com-personal github account
   HostName github.com
   User git
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal
   
# Work account
Host github.com-organization github account   
   HostName github.com
   User git
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
```

In the code above, we have two different values. One is the work repository, and another for the user's repository. The values enable you to add and update the SSH config of the GitHub repositories.

### Cloning the Repositories
Finally, we have to clone repositories. While cloning, make sure that you use the hostnames that we used during SSH configuration. To clone the repositories, execute the below clone command.

#### Cloning personal repository
Cloning your personal private projects, you use this command.
`git clone git@github.com:your-github-account/private-project-repo.git`

#### Cloning work repository
Cloning your company's projects, you will use this command.
`git clone git@github.myorganization.com:org-account/company-project-repo.git`

### Conclusion
That's all there is for this article. I hope it will be helpful. Also, I hope it helps you understand how to use multiple SSH keys for multiple GitHub accounts.

Happy learning!
