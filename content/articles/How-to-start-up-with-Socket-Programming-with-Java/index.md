This article is about Sockets. It will give you a glimpse of how clients and servers communicate over the internet.

### Introduction

Socket programming is a means of communicating data between two computers across a network. Connections can be made using either a **connection-oriented protocol** or a **connectionless protocol**. TCP/IP, a connection-oriented protocol, will be used in our case.

Before exchanging data, two computers must establish a link in connection-oriented protocols. In contrast, you don't require every packet to arrive at its intended destination for connectionless. It is made feasible via UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

To demonstrate sockets further, we shall use the Client/Server architecture. Client and server communicate by writing to and reading from the socket connection. The machines must have each other's network information to make this connection.

### Definition of a Socket

A Socket is a communication **endpoint** that serves as a link between two machines on a network. It has a socket number, which the TCP/IP layer can use to identify the application that receives the data. Additionally, a port number and an IP address are what make up an endpoint.

#### What is TCP?
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) - This is one of the most important protocols of the Internet Protocols suite. It is a widely used protocol for data transmission in a network that operates in Client/Server point-to-point mode.

#### Two categories of Sockets:

1. A server socket awaits a request from a client.
2. Client socket - utilized for sending and receiving requests from clients.

#### The client has to know two things about the server:

1. Its server's IP address 
2. Its port number

>The ports 0-1024 are for administrative use only (e.g.  21 for FTP, 23 for Telnet, 25 for email, and 80 for HTTP). In our program, we'll be using port number 5000.

#### When we make a socket connection in the Java programming language, we go through the following steps:

- The Server constructs a `ServerSocket` object to specify the port number on which our conversation will occur. Exception handling methods are in use whenever an I/O error occurs. **Throws** an **I/OException** or a **try** **catch** block is used.

- The `accept()` function is called by the server. This method waits for a client to connect to the server on a specific port before returning.

- A client creates a `Socket` object, giving the server name and the connecting port number as the server awaits.

- The `Socket` class constructor will attempt to connect the client to the server and port number provided. The client now has a socket object that can connect to the server if communication occurs.

- The server's `accept()` method returns a reference to a new server socket connected to the client's socket.
 
>If the connection is successful, the client and server can then communicate using **I/O streams**. The client and server socket classes provide the **I/O streams**. The client's OutputStream communicates with the server's InputStream, and the server's OutputStream communicates with the client's InputStream.
A stream is a collection of sequenced data, in case you didn't know. 

#### There are two types of streams:
1. A character stream (usually used with text files).
2. A byte stream (usually used with images).

A character stream is in human-readable language while a byte stream is in machine language, a language understandable by the CPU.

>In this situation, the client and server will simultaneously broadcast messages to each other's streams. Because TCP is a two-way communication protocol, this is conceivable.

#### Programming on the Server-side

A `server` socket is a subclass of the ServerSocket that uses the constructor below:

```java
serversocket = new ServerSocket(int port)
```
Port: the port number on which the server will listen for the client's requests.

>The ServerSocket object stays idle, waiting for network requests. Our client will attempt to connect to port 5000, which we have specified.

**Note** :
Make sure the ports are the same other than that, the connection will fail.

There will be two while loops in use:

**First Loop** - This ensures that the server is indeed running.
**Second Loop** - Ensures that the server interacts with the client after connection until the client disconnects.

```java
while (true)
{  
    try {  
   socket = serversocket.accept();  
   
   inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream());  
   outputStreamWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream()); 
   
   bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(inputStreamReader);  
   bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(outputStreamWriter);  
  while (true) { 
  String msgFromClient = bufferedReader.readLine();  
  
  System.out.println("Client: " + msgFromClient); 
  bufferedWriter.write(" MSG Received");  
  bufferedWriter.newLine();  
  bufferedWriter.flush();  
  
 if (msgFromClient.equalsIgnoreCase("BYE"))  
                break;  
  
  }
      socket.close();  
      inputStreamReader.close();  
      outputStreamWriter.close();  
      bufferedReader.close();  
      bufferedWriter.close();  
  
    } catch (IOException e) {  
        e.printStackTrace();  
  }  
}
```
   
#### Methods used in ServerSocket
- `public InputStream getInputStream()` - returns an InputStream object that receives data.
- `public OutputStream getOutputStream()`- returns an OutputStream for sending data.
- `public Socket accept()` - Waits for client connection (the program won't continue until the client is connected). When you connect, you'll get a socket object that you may use to communicate with the client. 
- `void close()` - closes the server socket i.e stops waiting for requests from clients.

#### Full Server-Side Application
```java
package com. company; 
 
import java.io.*;  
import java.net.ServerSocket;  
import java.net.Socket;  
  
public class Server {  
  
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {   
  Socket socket ;  
  InputStreamReader inputStreamReader ;  
  OutputStreamWriter outputStreamWriter ;  
  BufferedReader bufferedReader ;  
  BufferedWriter bufferedWriter ;  
  ServerSocket serversocket ;  
  
serversocket = new ServerSocket(5000);  
  
 while (true) {  
   try {  
         
         socket = serversocket.accept();  
  
inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream());  
outputStreamWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream());  
bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(inputStreamReader);  
bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(outputStreamWriter);  
while (true)
{  
String msgFromClient = bufferedReader.readLine();  
System.out.println("Client: " + msgFromClient);   
bufferedWriter.write(" MSG Received"); 
bufferedWriter.newLine();  
bufferedWriter.flush();  
if (msgFromClient.equalsIgnoreCase("BYE"))  
  break;  
  }  
        socket.close();  
        inputStreamReader.close();  
        outputStreamWriter.close();  
        bufferedReader.close();  
        bufferedWriter.close();  
  
          } catch (IOException e) {  
            e.printStackTrace();  
          }  
        }  
    }  
}
```
The output of this  program is:
```
Connected
Client: Hey there 
Client: I am doing this for the first time
Client: BYE
Closing connection
```
### Programming on the Client-side

#### Establish a Socket Connection
There are two ways to get a Socket instance:

1. The server receives it as a return value of the accept method.
2. You can use the following code to create a Socket:

```java
socket = new Socket("localhost", 5000);
```
Localhost is a domain name that redirects you to your computer, similar to google.com. It resolves to 127.0.0.1 as the IP address.
A port number is in the second argument.

We generate I/O streams using the socket object, just as we did before:

```java
inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream());  
outputStreamWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream());
``` 
Client-side, we need to use a Scanner object to get input from the user from the console/terminal. 

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
```
`System. in` specifies that we are getting the keyboard input.

#### Methods used in Client Socket
- `public InputStream getInputStream()` - returns an InputStream object for receiving data. Our Server will keep on receiving messages until client sends "BYE".
- `public OutputStream getOutputStream()`- returns an OutputStream for sending data.
- `BufferReader()` - Wraps inputStreamReader to improve efficiency
- `BufferWriter()` - Wraps outputStreamReader to improve efficiency
- `BufferedWriter.flush()` - Flushes the streams. The flush method is invoked when the buffer is complete.
- `void close()`- closes all streams and the socket.
  
#### Full Client-Side Application
```java
package com. company;  
  
import java.io.*;  
import java.net.Socket;  
import java.util.Scanner;  
  
public class client {  
 public static void main(String[] args) {  
  Socket socket = null;  
  InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = null;  
  OutputStreamWriter outputStreamWriter = null;  
  BufferedReader bufferedReader = null;  
  BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = null;  
  
try {  
socket = new Socket("localhost", 5000);  
inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream());  
outputStreamWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream());  
bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(inputStreamReader);  
bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(outputStreamWriter);  
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);  
while (true)
 {  
  String msgToSend = scanner.nextLine();  
  bufferedWriter.write(msgToSend);  
  bufferedWriter.newLine();  
  bufferedWriter.flush();  
  
  System.out.println("Server: " + bufferedReader.readLine());  
  
if (msgToSend.equalsIgnoreCase("BYE"))  
    break;  
  }  
} catch (IOException e) {  
   e.printStackTrace();  
} finally {  
try {  
if (socket != null)  
 socket.close();  
if (inputStreamReader != null)  
  inputStreamReader.close();  
if (outputStreamWriter != null)  
 outputStreamWriter.close();  
if (bufferedReader != null)  
 bufferedReader.close();  
if (bufferedWriter != null)  
 bufferedWriter.close();  
} catch (IOException e) {  
  e.printStackTrace();  
          }  
        }  
    }  
}
```
A sample output of this code:
```
Hey there 
Server:  Message Received
I am doing this for the first time
Server:  Message Received
BYE
Server:  Message Received
```
### How to Run Programs in a Variety of Applications
#### Using Intellij or another integrated development environment:
- compile the two programs.
- **Run** the server program first, then the client application.
- Type messages in the client window, which will be received and shown by the server window at the same time.
- To exit, type **BYE**.

#### If you're using Command Prompt/Terminal:
- Launch the server program as the java server, depending on how you saved it.
- Run the client program on a terminal.
- Then, in the client window, type messages.
Example 
```
Hey there 
Server:  Message Received
am doing this for the first time
Server:  Message Received
BYE
Server:  Message Received
```
4. The server receives and simultaneously shows:
```
Connected
Client: Hey there 
Client: I am doing this for the first time
Client: BYE
Closing connection
```
>Note of importance:
If the port is already in use, the port number may result in an error. To solve the issue, change the port number to a value that isn't commercially licensed.

### Conclusion 
In this tutorial, we learned about sockets and the TCP/IP protocol. We covered the fundamentals of socket programming and how they relate to the Java programming language. We've also gotten a clear picture of the data flow and client/server interaction.
I strongly advise the reader to apply what they've learned so far to writing networking programs in the Java programming language.
